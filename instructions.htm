<h3>Saving complex queries</h3>
<p>
On the top left corner of the table, you'll see a string that looks like col1:[0,5]|col2:A;B;C... If you save this string, you can use it later to apply the same filters by pasting it into the <i>append filters</i> box in the navigation bar.
<p>
You can also save the results of a complex query by clicking the save (floppy) icon on the nav bar. This will give you a tab-demilited file of the filtered results.
